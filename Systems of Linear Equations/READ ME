Consider a system of linear equations in matrix form, Ax=y, where A is an m√ón matrix. 
Recall that this means there are m equations and n unknowns in our system. 
A solution to a system of linear equations is an x in Rn that satisfies the matrix form equation. 
Depending on the values that populate A and y, there are three distinct solution possibilities for x.
Either there is no solution for x, or there is one, unique solution for x, or there are an infinite number of solutions for x. 
Case 1: There is no solution for x. If rank([A,y])=rank(A)+1
Case 2: There is a unique solution for x. If  rank([A,y])=rank(A) & rank(A)=n 
Case 3: There is an infinite number of solutions for x. If  rank([A,y])=rank(A) & rank(A) < n

# WE here will only discuss how we solve a systems of equations when it has unique solution.
